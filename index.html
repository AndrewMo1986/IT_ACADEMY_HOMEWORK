        <h2> <center>Present-tense. An unlikely (non) Buddhist take on the Death of a Parent.</center></h2>
        <p>I have many thoughts
            <mark>about that — as a son, a buddhist and man.</mark>
            If only <i>to assuage my
                feelings</i>
            of grief a bit
            and to <u>avoid relying too much on others,</u> I have been writing them down, since June. There is no
            avoiding
            death or
            <del>loneliness</del>
            any longer, although I <b>believe part of me very much,</b> and quite reasonably wants
            to.

            <mark>On Memorial Day weekend,</mark>
            my mother choked on hot-dog, and her heart stopped. I find it painfully ironic that
            the last solid food my American-Italian Mother ate was a hot-dog. My father could not resuscitate her and
            she slipped into a coma. <i>I didn’t know about the incident until the next</i> day when my brother called.
            We
            already knew that she was suffering from dementia or something akin to it — hence the swallowing issues.
            <u>When she came out of the coma, she received another diagnosis</u> — 
            <del>stomach cancer.</del>
            I went to bed, for about
            three days. My brother would call and tell me what was going on, but most people I spoke with didn’t really
            know what to say — <b>if anything at all.</b> This was the first time I noticed very few people know how to
            deal
            with death, or can appreciate another person’s experience. There was also an awkwardness around tearfulness,
            weakness and vulnerability — I’m a “man” after all. “Get out of bed,” said the man inside the man.
